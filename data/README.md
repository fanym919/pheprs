# Datasets for use-case study

This repo is just a collection of some datasets that we use to demo our proposed model.

## Dataset 1

[source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/breast-cancer-dataset)

**Description:**
Breast cancer is the most common cancer amongst women in the world. It accounts for 25% of all cancer cases, and affected over 2.1 Million people in 2015 alone. It starts when cells in the breast begin to grow out of control. These cells usually form tumors that can be seen via X-ray or felt as lumps in the breast area.

The key challenges against itâ€™s detection is how to classify tumors into malignant (cancerous) or benign(non cancerous). We ask you to complete the analysis of classifying these tumors using machine learning (with SVMs) and the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset.

**Acknowledgements:**
This dataset has been referred from Kaggle.

**Objective:**
* Understand the Dataset & cleanup (if required).
* Build classification models to predict whether the cancer type is Malignant or Benign.
* Also fine-tune the hyperparameters & compare the evaluation metrics of various classification algorithms.

## Dataset 2

**About this file**

* y. The outcomes. A factor with two levels denoting whether a mass is malignant ("M") or benign ("B").
* x. The predictors. A matrix with the mean, standard error and worst value of each of 10 nuclear measurements on the slide, for 30 total features per biopsy:
* radius. Nucleus radius (mean of distances from center to points on perimeter).
* texture. Nucleus texture (standard deviation of grayscale values).
* perimeter. Nucleus perimeter.
* area. Nucleus area.
* smoothness. Nucleus smoothness (local variation in radius lengths).
* compactness. Nucleus compactness (perimeter^2/area - 1).
* concavity, Nucleus concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour).
* concave_pts. Number of concave portions of the nucleus contour.
* symmetry. Nucleus symmetry.
* fractal_dim. Nucleus fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" -1).

## Dataset 3

**Data Set Information:**

Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. A few of the images can be found at [Web Link]

Separating plane described above was obtained using Multisurface Method-Tree (MSM-T) [K. P. Bennett, "Decision Tree Construction Via Linear Programming." Proceedings of the 4th Midwest Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science Society, pp. 97-101, 1992], a classification method which uses linear programming to construct a decision tree. Relevant features were selected using an exhaustive search in the space of 1-4 features and 1-3 separating planes.

The actual linear program used to obtain the separating plane in the 3-dimensional space is that described in: [K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: "Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets", Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].
